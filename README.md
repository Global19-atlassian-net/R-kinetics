R-kinetcs
=========

A vignette that describes how to perform kinetic analyses using the R
suite of tools provided by Pacific Biosciences. This project is
structured as follows:

* Src : contains example code/scripts to perform modification
detection
* Data : contains two example datasets which have been generated by
Pacific Biosciences with known modifications to facilitate in the
development of modification detection algorithms. These datasets are
identical to those datasets that one would obtain by performing a
sequencing run with a PacBio instrument.
* ReferenceRepository : contains the two reference sequences used
during this analysis.
